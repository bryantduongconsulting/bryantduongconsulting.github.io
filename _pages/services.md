## Qualifications

As a PhD student at the University of Pennsylvania (Penn), I offer career and admissions counseling online via meeting software of choice, with a focus on providing the highest level of service. A long term relationship is built on trust and open communication; I respond to most emails/texts within 3-6 hours.

My students call on me for assistance on career and undergraduate/graduate admissions counsulting. If you are looking for help with admissions application preparation, admission essay prep, or career consulting - please do not hesitate to reach out. 

As a background, I have been assisting/tutoring students for the past decade and scored 99th percentile on undergraduate admissions exams such as the SAT and SAT subject tests. 
I have tutored/assisted many undergraduate level to graduate level students since 2017 and have won many awards. I have also commented and revised Personal Statements and admissions applications since 2020 for students applying to STEM graduate and undergraduate programs/universities as well as assisted in selecting a shortlist of schools to apply to.  In the past and present, I have mentored many students through various student programs such as Penn's Engineering Online Mentorship, Optum's Technology Development Program, and Encorps for middle school mentorship/tutoring.

I earned a BA in Cognitive Science at Berkeley, MBA at University of California - Davis, and Masters in CS at the University of Pennsylvania with the following competitive awards/scholarships.
* Regents & Chancellor's Scholarship - Berkeley
* Stokes Scholarship (full tuition) - Berkeley
* Fontaine Scholar Award - Penn

My students regularly see admissions to the top 25-50 universities. Some examples include Penn, UC Irvine, Meta, and various companies/start ups. Please see [testimonials](https://bryantduongconsulting.github.io/testimonials/).

Please schedule an initial discovery meeting [here](https://calendly.com/bryanttduong/30min).

## Meeting Scheduling

Lessons will be scheduled virtually with client with the following rules:

* Same-day cancellations for online appointments/meetings, reschedulings, or no-shows by the student or by their parent/guardian without an excusable exception will incur a fee of 50% of the scheduled session. There is no penalty for cancelling or rescheduling the day before a session or earlier. However, if a student cancels or reschedules too often, we will need to discuss this issue on a case-by-case basis. This policy also applies in reverse. If I have to same day cancel or reschedule, your session is half off.
* Slight delays in joining the session are okay, but do not make it a recurring event.
* Notifications for cancellations or reschedulings may be sent via email.
