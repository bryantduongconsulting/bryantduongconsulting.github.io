"Bryant is incredibly skilled in the academic writing process and crafting compelling Statements of Purpose that highlights your strengths with clarity and impact. His precise attention to detail, helpful feedback and narrative finesse makes him the perfect go-to for SOP writing. Would highly recommend :)" - AB, Graduate School Admissions (CS)

"Bryant is able to provide experience-based feedback for those actively working towards a software engineering position with little experience or pursuing graduate-level training for the purpose of better employment opportunities. In a remote-capacity, Bryant is able to advise on the strongest trajectories that look promising for long-term career stability in software engineering. He is always on time to meetings. He is always responsive. He has a great personality and is very easy to work with. Highly recommend!" - RR, Graduate School Consulting (Math)

## Career Consulting Testimonials

"Bryant has a rare ability to cut through the noise and offer direct, actionable career advice that helped me navigate a PIP, stand out as a software engineer, and ultimately grow in my role with confidence while recently helping me switch to a new company. Heâ€™s not only sharp and strategic, especially when it comes to job applications and optimizing transitions, but also calm, logical, and a great listener who knows exactly how to keep you grounded and focused." - AV, Career Consulting (SWE)

"Bryant helped me prepare for job interviews, going step by step and explaining how to talk about my experiences in a relevant way to a software engineering position despite not having any prior internships. He also helped me fix my resume to be more professional. I highly recommend Bryant if you need to find a SWE job out of undergrad." - KL, Career Counsulting (SWE)

"Bryant is able to remain a consistent advantage when searching for jobs. During my search for product management jobs, he was not only able to shortlist companies worth applying to but also told me about new grad geared development programs that were more willing to take on a cohort with little to no experience. He also helped me navigate my CV and interview process." - TC, Career Consulting (Product Management)
